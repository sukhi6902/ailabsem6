        "The A* algorithm works by expanding the node with the lowest f-score. The f-score is calculated as the sum of the node's cost and the heuristic value for the node. The heuristic value is an estimate of the distance from the node to the goal. The A* algorithm always expands the node with the lowest f-score, which ensures that it will eventually find the shortest path to the goal."
